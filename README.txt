Exotic Butterfly Net (LD32 version)
Copyright (c) 2015 fanzyflani
Made for Ludum Dare #32

Dust off your Game Boy Advance emulator, it's time to kick arse and drink green tea.

Tested with VBA-M and Higan.
Colours aren't tuned for a proper GBA so it'll look a bit crap on Higan.

To select a difficulty, hold A or B, then tap START.
(A is for easy, B is for normal, what kind of alphabet book is this)

Controls:
- Arrows: move
- A: attack
- B: focus
- START: reset game

Default VBA-M mappings for the "Windows build":
- Arrows: Arrows
- A: X
- B: Z
- START: Enter
